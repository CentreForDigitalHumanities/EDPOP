    Migrate ResearchGroup data into Project table

    Projects are not exactly analogous to ResearchGroups (which is why a new model is
    used in the first place), but this migration provides the smoothest transition of
    existing data.

    Note: project names must be unique (to be used in URIs), while research groups need
    not be. This migration will fail if the database contains duplicate names. If that
    happens, manually edit the data before migrating.
