class RDFField(ABC):
    '''
    Abstract class for RDF fields.

    A subclass of RDFField must implement how the field represents values in a graph and
    in the Python object. This can be a single triple or a complex structure.

    In most cases, a subclass should implement the following methods:
    - `__init__`: optional, can be used to set any parameters that apply.
    - `get`: takes model instance as input and returns the modelled value of the field
        based on the graph data.
    - `_stored_triples`: takes a model instance as input and returns the scope of the
        field; that is, a subset of the graph that the field is modelling.
    - `_triples_to_store`: returns a collection of triples that represents the modelled
        value.
    
    An `RDFModel` will use the `get`, `set`, and `clear` endpoints. `set` and `clear` have
    default implementations based on `_stored_triples` and `_triples_to_store`.
    Alternatively, you could implement `set` and `clear` directly; in that case, it's not
    necessary to implement `_stored_triples` and `_triples_to_store`.

    The implementations of the methods listed above should use `self.get_graph()` to
    fetch the correct graph for reading and writing triples. By default, this will be the
    graph of the model instance. To use a constant graph, you can pass a `graph` in the
    initialiser. If the graph is chosen dynamically, you can override the method
    `get_graph`.

    def get_graph(self, instance):
        '''
        Return the graph in which to save data.

        Parameters:
            instance: the RDFModel instance

        By default, this will return the graph passed on on initialisation, if any, or
        the graph of the model instance.

        You can override this method to choose a graph dynamically.

class RDFPredicateField(RDFField):
    '''
    Models a property + object in the graph. It checks whether, for a model identified by
    `s`, the triple `(s, p, o)` exists in the graph. This is represented as a boolean.

    For instance, you could write a field like this:
    
    `knows_alice = RDFPredicateField(FOAF.knows, URIRef('https://example.com/alice'))`
    
    Note that unlike the RDFPropertyField (and derivatives), this field does not model all
    triples with the provided property. That is, if `A` is an instance of a model with
    `RDFPredicateField(B, C)`, the value of the field represents whether the triple
    `(A, B, C)` is present in a graph. The presence of another triple `(A, B, D)` is
    considered irrelevant, and will not be affected when you save the field.

    Models a property relationship. For a model instance identified by `s`, this field

    The modelled value is a list of all objects. By default, each object is represented
    as an RDF node, i.e. an `URIRef` or `BNode`, unless it is a `Literal`, in which case
    it will be represented by its value.

    The methods `node_to_value` and `value_to_node` control the representation of each

    Child classes should implement `_quads_to_store` and `_stored_quads`; these are
